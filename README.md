# Winter 2020 Developer Intern Challenge Question

<br>

You can save your work in a text file, link, etc. and have it ready with you for your interview (you can also add it on GitHub). 

<br>

## TASK: Build an image repository.

You can tackle this challenge using any technology you want. This is an open-ended task.

Please provide brief instructions on how to use your application.

Extra Information: You can, if you wish, use frameworks, libraries and external dependencies to help you get faster to the parts you are interested in building, if this helps you; or start from scratch.

Please focus on what interests you the most. If you need inspiration, here are examples of what you can work on. IF you work on these ideas, we recommend choosing only one or two.

## Ideas:
- SEARCH function
  - from characteristics of the images
  - from text
  - from an image (search for similar images)
- ADD image(s) to the repository
  - one / bulk / enormous amount of images
  - private or public (permissions)
  - secure uploading and stored images
- DELETE image(s)
  - one / bulk / selected / all images
  - Prevent a user deleting images from another user (access control)
  - secure deletion of images
- SELL/BUY images
  - ability to manage inventory
  - set price
  - discounts
  - handle money
